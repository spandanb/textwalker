# Text Walker

## Overview

The text walker arises from the necessity of regular expressions in ad-hoc text parsing;
and the difficulty of writing regex's correctly. 
This happened while I was constructing an involved regex. 
I would write a part of the pattern; test it; and then add to it to the next bit. 

The text walker attempt to turn this intuitive way of parsing text into the API.

## TODO
- properly define the grammar supported
